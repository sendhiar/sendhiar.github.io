# About

With over 5 years of experience in independent music media, I've crafted compelling essays and written engaging reviews. My passion lies in uncovering emerging talent from the sidestream scenes, where I've developed a knack for storytelling and a keen eye for detail.

Aside from writing, I also like conducting thought-provoking interviews, drawing out candid insights from musicians and industry insiders, which allows me to craft authentic narratives that resonate with readers.
